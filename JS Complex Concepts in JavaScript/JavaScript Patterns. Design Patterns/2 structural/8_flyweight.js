// Flyweight

/*
Flyweight design pattern serves so that we can 
effectively transmit and work with data through various objects. 
A very typical example, for example, in browsers is loading various images, 
and that is, for example, in the browser it uses a pattern to avoid repeated 
loading those elements that have already been downloaded
